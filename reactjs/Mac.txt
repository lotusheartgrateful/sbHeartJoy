 Go to the Github project folder
 Ensure node and npm are available
 node -v
 npm -v
 
 Now, try installing create-react-app
 npm install -g create-react-app (installs globally).
 If not administrator, this will fail. So, use sudo command as below:
 sudo npm install -g create-react-app
 
 Now, try typing just "create-react-app" and see if it works. If it says, "command not found", then the .npm-packages is not available globally.
 So, add to the PATH & than to the bash_profile by typing the below 2 lines:
 
 echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.npm-packages/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
 source ~/.bash_profile
 
 Now, check again!
 Just type create_react_app & if no error, we are good to create a new project
 
 create_react_app <new project name>
 
 cd <new project name>
 npm start
 
 This will start the server & open localhost port for the new project created.
 You can delete all files from the /src and /public directories to get started on your project
